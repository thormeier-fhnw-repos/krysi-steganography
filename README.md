# krysi: Steganography

This repo showcases steganography by hiding a picture within another.

## Hiding an image

Put the two images (one to hide, the other as the container) in the folder
`resources/in/`. Afterwards exsecute `HideImage.main` and follow the
on-screen instructions. The resulting image should appear in `resources/out`.

## Unveil a hidden image

Put the image that contains another one in the folder `resources/in`.
Afterwards, execute `UnveilImage.main`. The resulting image should
appear in `resources/out`.
